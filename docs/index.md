This repository contains data of the The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD). With GISD our aims were  to  develop  a  regional  socioeconomic  deprivation  index  for  Germany that (1) can be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) provides a basis for explaining regional health differences in Germany. 

Originally GISD was submitted to [GESIS Datorium](https://datorium.gesis.org/xmlui/handle/10.7802/1460). But as we plan to update GISD anually with when new data from www.inkar.de is available, it will be hosted as at github.

If you need help with GISD please feel free to [contact us](https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/Kontaktformulare/K/Kroll_Lars_Eric/Integrator.html) or just file an [Issue at GitHub](https://github.com/lekroll/GISD/issues).

## Background
The core data stem from the [INKAR](www.inkar.de) (indicators and maps on spatial and urban development in Germany and Europe) database compiled by Germany’s Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development. Factor analysis is used for indexing and the weighting of indicators for the three dimensions of education, occupation and income. 
It is generated at the levels of associations of municipalities, administrative districts and administrative regions.The  German  Index  of  Socioeconomic  Deprivation  illustrates  regional  socioeconomic  differences  at  different  spatial levels and contributes to explaining regional health differences. 

This index is intended for use in research as well as by federal and federal state health reporting systems and should enable access to new sources of data for investigating the links between social inequalities and health in Germany.
